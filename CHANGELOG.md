# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-04

### Enhanced
- **Bubble Card Close Button** - Close button now uses lighter gray (`dracula-comment` #6272a4) for better header distinction
- **Toggle Switch Depth** - Enhanced ON/OFF visual contrast for clearer state indication

### Changed
- `bubble-pop-up-main-background-color`: `dracula-current-line` → `dracula-comment` (lighter close button)
- `switch-checked-button-color`: `dracula-purple` → `dracula-foreground` (white knob when ON)
- `switch-checked-track-color`: `dracula-current-line` → `dracula-purple` (purple track when ON)
- `switch-unchecked-track-color`: `dracula-current-line` → `dracula-background` (darker track when OFF)

### Design
- ON switches: Purple track + white knob (elevated, prominent)

- Better depth perception through color contrast
- Close button subtly elevated without overwhelming UI
